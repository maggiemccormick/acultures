And by that logic, it appears that MVHS can’t support an athletic environment if students are too busy supporting their academic success. For many students here at MV, after-school sports take a large role in their daily lives, and according to them team sports foster unbreakable friendships. It goes beyond another time commitment though; these wins and losses define MVHS on a different field in a way academics can’t.</div>

                <div class="module-text align-left"><font color="black"> <p>The final whistle blew. It was over. 6-0. Seven consecutive defeats in my first year as a high school soccer player. My teammates and I hanged our heads in shame as we walk over to our disappointed, lethargic coach. Usually, he’d give us encouragement through high-fives and the “good jobs,” but today he just walked off, leaving us to congratulate our opposing team on their victory. After feigning fake sincerity to our opponents, I got ready to go home to take a nice, cold shower until I heard the conversation between an opposing player and his mom.</p>
                <p>“Hey! Congratulations on your victory today!” the mom said.<br />
                “It’s just MVHS, mom,” the boy said as he casually trotted to his car.</p>
                <p>My muscles slowly tensed up as I got ready to confront his demeaning behavior. Yet, I couldn’t. I just couldn’t back it up. My team just lost seven straight, what could I possibly say to refute his argument? Say, “Oh yea, have you seen our badminton team?”. Instead, I held my anger under control as I went home, utterly disappointed.</p>
                <p>Now, as a senior, nothing much has changed. Many people I have played against still view us as the “Asian school that only cares about academics.” Yes, our student body is about 83% Asian. Yes, many of us are driven by our desire to get into a competitive college. However, it doesn't mean we don’t care about sports. From the last four years as a soccer player, I have seen genuine passion and grit from every single player I have played with time and time again. I never once doubted the commitment each Matador puts in their respective sports. Then, why are we disdained by our neighboring schools? Why can’t we produce world-class talent that thrives on a professional level?</p>
                <p>Well, the problem is our parents. Yup, our insightful, lovable, always supportive parents. I think most people can agree that even though our parents support our respective sports, they still want us to excel in other passions in our lives. They want us to have various career options for our future so that if our first career doesn’t work out, we have other routes to fall back on. Thus, we are unable to commit 100% of our time and commitment to sports since we spend our finite in other passions we pursue.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, our school’s sports falters – we’ve had 7-0 defeats in soccer, 35-7 losses in football, 68-32 humiliation in basketball. However, that is completely fine. What makes our school so special is that we excel in the most important aspect of sports than any other American high school: safety. Through the extensive care from coaches, trainers, and faculty, the MVHS athletes are protected from any discrimination, allowing us to be in a safe, communal environment. This results in athletes developing real-life beneficial skills of teamwork, social skills, and trust. So can we really fault our parents in the end? Probably not.</p>
                <p>In the end, even though I suffered through countless heartbreaks over the last four years as a high school soccer player, I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I was given. Soccer gave me the dedicated, strong-willed people that will stay friends with me for a lifetime. Soccer gave me the drive to push myself every single day. Soccer gave me an outlet to let out all my stress and anger on the field. I can’t thank MVHS enough for how much soccer has been beneficial in my life. I hope that the people reading this can feel the same way about MVHS sports. I understand that it’s frustrating to see your beloved team suffer humiliation in a loss, but at the end, the lessons and experience you gain from MVHS sports can be far more rewarding for your life than you think.</p></font></div>
